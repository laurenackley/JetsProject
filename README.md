# Jets Program

# Description
This is a program that reads in Jets/Flying objects from a file and stores it in an array list. A menu shows to offer to view all flying objects. Next gives you the option to fly all available. When you select that option it will give you the length that they can fly in miles. 
Option 3 will tell you which flies the fastest. Option 4 was the hardest for me to figure out. I had an issue where it would only print the one that was already in the jets.txt file. The next 2 options are implementations of interfaces. 
You can add objects and remove them.

# Lessons Learned
I learned the importance of for loops. Also it was very important to set a variable for the index then have it print out the index instead. That helped me fix the issue of the longest range. 
I also learned how great it is to finish something that I thought was impossible at first!
